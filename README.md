# How it works

I'll make a youtube video about this if I can

It uses Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation under Finite Fields of the form GF(p^1) to encrypt text

:)

# BTW

 `CLI.py` is the most user friendly way to use this

 You can also utilize `PolyEncCLI.bat` if you are on Windows

 \* Sorry but I don't have any way to test bash scripts, so any contribution to help me do this will help *
